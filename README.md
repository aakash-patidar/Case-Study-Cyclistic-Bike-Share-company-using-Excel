## Introduction
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. As a data analyst, our primary objective is to understand the behaviour of casual riders and annual members to develop a strategic marketing approach aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The director of marketing believes Cyclistic's future depends on getting as many people as possible to sign up for annual memberships. To achieve this goal, we need to use data to understand how casual riders and annual members use our bikes differently.

The key steps followed in the analysis:
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

### About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Moreno(the director) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

## Data Analysis Process
### Ask:  
The "ask" phase of the data analysis process involves recognizing the current problem, understanding stakeholder expectations, defining the business task, and identifying how insights will benefit stakeholders.

**Business Task:**  
Analyze the behavior of casual riders and annual members in order to develop a strategic marketing approach aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

**Key Stakeholders**  
The key stakeholders for this project include:  
Lily Moreno: The Director of marketing and my Manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.

### Prepare:  
The "prepare" phase of the data analysis process involves collecting and preparing the necessary data for analysis. Key steps include identifying data sources such as databases, spreadsheets, or external sources, and then extracting the relevant information.  
- The dataset used for this project is public data provided by Motivate International Inc. It can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. The dataset consists of monthly files from January 2023 to December 2023.
- In each file of the dataset, there are 13 columns that describe different aspects of the bike rides. The columns consist of the ride ID, bike type, starting and ending station IDs, names of the starting and ending stations, geographic coordinates, and membership type for each ride.
