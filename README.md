## Introduction
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. As a data analyst, our primary objective is to understand the behaviour of casual riders and annual members to develop a strategic marketing approach aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The director of marketing believes Cyclistic's future depends on getting as many people as possible to sign up for annual memberships. To achieve this goal, we need to use data to understand how casual riders and annual members use our bikes differently.

The key steps followed in the analysis:
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

### About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Moreno(the director) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
